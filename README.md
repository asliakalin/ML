# Natural Language Processing Notebooks:

1. Sentiment Analysis for Movie Reviews:
    - Generative probabilistic model for sentiment analysis of movie reviews
    - Bag of Words implementation
    - Sentiment Dictionaries, punctuation and syntax analysis
    - Feature engineering focus to increase model accuracy
    
2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Text Classification
    - implements the forward pass and backpropagation for a convolutional neural network with sparse inputs for text classification.
    - Forward Function calculates the probability of the positive class for an input text.
    - Using the gradient update equations for V and U, the backward function implements the gradient updates.
